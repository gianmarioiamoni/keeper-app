# keeper-app
Notes application with database. Example of MERN application

I extended the Keeper React application introduced in the "The Complete Web Development Bootcamp 2023" by Angela Yu with the following features:
- MongoDB storage with Mongoose
- Modify an existing note functionality

I used Axios to interface frontend with backend.
